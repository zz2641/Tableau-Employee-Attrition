The dashboard consists of three parts: Count Summary; Attrition rate Distribution and DE & I

 - The total attrition rate is **16.12%**, which is higher than the ideal **10% benchmark**.


 - While Work Life Balance Perception and Business Travel do not distingush the churned and remaining, working overtime can possibly be a driver for attrition with over **50%** of the leaving employees report have working overtime issue.


 - The top roles that have higher attrition rate than average: **Sales representatives**,**Laboratory Techinician**,**Human Resource**,**Sales Executive**,**Research Scientist**. The sales team is experiencing high attrition rate.


 - Employees with **fewer years of experience** are more likely to leave. After including age and income, we can also see a majority of the churned employees are **young and have relatively lower income**.


 - Distance from home seems to be **not a big issue** with regards to attrition as the rate is pretty constant from short distance to long.


 - Though Job involvement and Job satisfaction indicate the low involvement and low satifaction correlate to high attrition rate successfully from the graphs, attrition rate of highly engaged and well-satisfied employees still experience high attrition rate, **which flag potentials other than involvement and satifaction that drive staff away**.


 - At large, the company has more males than females, not in drastic contrast, and correspondingly has more male employees leaving than female. We don't observe any potential gender discrimation from this perspective. However, when again including age and income, we do observe female leaver of similar age earn fewer than male.
