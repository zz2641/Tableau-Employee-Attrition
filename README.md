 - The total attrition rate is **16.12%**, which is higher than the ideal **10% benchmark**.
 - While Work Life Balance Perception and Business Travel do not distingush the churned and remaining, working overtime can possibly be a driver for attrition with over **50%** of the leaving employees report have working overtime issue.
